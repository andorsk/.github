### About Me  

I build scalable, impactful technology with a focus on decentralized identity, AI, and backend systems. 

Currently, I co-chair the **Decentralized Web Node WG at DIF**, co-lead the **Trust Registry Task Force at Trust Over IP**, and chair the **Technical Steering Committee at DIF**.  

I thrive at the intersection of **engineering and R&D**, balancing exploration with production-grade execution. With multiple CTO roles and years of open-source leadership, I’ve built teams, products, and infrastructure from the ground up. 

#### **Technology**  
- **Backend & AI** – Golang, Python, ML/AI, Computer Vision  
- **Decentralized Identity** – DIDs, VCs, Trust Registries, Decentralized Web Nodes  
- **Infrastructure** – GCP, Terraform/Tofu, DevOps, GitHub Actions
- **Languages**: Go, Python, Typescript. A little bit of Rust. 

#### **Focus Areas**  

- **AI & Behavioral Understanding** – Two startups in AI-driven spatial intelligence  
- **Decentralized Identity & Trust** – Leading multiple open-source initiatives in the space  
- **Building & Scaling Teams** – Engineering, product, and strategy experience
- **Multi-Agent Theory** -- Decentralized Multi-agent interactions.
