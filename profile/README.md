Engineer, Builder, CTO, and Open Source Advocate
Palo Alto, CA

## Abstract
I like solving challenging problems that live on the intersection of technology and humans.

I am currently focused on decentralized identity solutions related to Decentralized Web Nodes. Co-Chair of Decentralized Web Node WG at Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Co-Lead of the Trust Registry Task Force @ Trust Over IP, and Chair of the Technical Steering Committee at DIF.

My style around engineering is to balance exploration with pragmatism. I love mature R&D, with an edge toward production grade results. Full stack, with a bend toward backend/ML, and a capability of cobbling together UI's on vue.js or other frameworks if needed. I classify myself as an autodidact, and I've learned most the skills I have today from real projects.

## Background
I always have viewed technology as a means toward the ends. I graduated Claremont McKenna ('14) with a Technology Policy Degree. I began my career in Silicon Valley, fell in love with the R&D Team at my first job in RetailNext, and moved my way toward engineering/R&D. We worked on building the Aurora camera, an edge based camera used for people tracking in retail spaces. For the next 6 years, I focused on the intersection of Spatial Intelligence, AI, and R&D. I met my wife in India, and lived there for 5 years while working with US Companies remotely.

A few years ago, I fell in love with the decentralized identity community and the mission it has reduce power bottlenecks in the fabric of society. I quickly engaged in a number of open source projects, and landed myself lead of a number of open source initiatives. Check out here for more information. I have now been CTO at two companies, and I've learned a lot from my experiences.
